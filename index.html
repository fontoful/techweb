        <h2>Desgining</h2>
        <p>
          We take a lot of pride in the web design, we use resources like
          photoshop, figma and other sites to get some good looking web designs
          and if this is handed to us, we make sure we translate that to code as
          people wish to have it
        </p>

      <div class="box">
        <img src="src/images/box2.jpg" />
        <h2>Coding</h2>
        <p>
          Translating a design into coding is our favorite stage. We love coding
          and we definitely enjoy when a design it's finally implemented to
          code.

        <h2>Server-side</h2>
        <p>
          Although most people that would hire us wouldn't need a back end for
          the websites, blogs or apps. We've got a dedicated team that will make
          sure we can manage the server side as well. We can do API requests,
          query Data bases and much more (all this if what it's meant to be
          built, it's something required)

          As you may know by now, having a website along with your business & company to showcase everything that your company has to offer. We make websites based on people's needs and complying with the design they wish to have for their webs/vlogs. <br>
